# Protein Sequence Hybrid Quantum-Classical Neural Network

## Overview
This project aims to explore the use of hybrid quantum-classical neural networks for the analysis and classification of protein sequences. Protein folding is a complex process, and understanding the intricacies of protein sequences can provide significant insights into biological functions and disease mechanisms. Traditional computational methods can be enhanced by quantum computing techniques, which may offer new avenues for solving problems in bioinformatics.

## Biological Context

### Protein Folding
Protein folding is the process by which a protein structure assumes its functional shape or conformation. It is a crucial aspect of biological activity since the function of a protein is directly related to its 3D structure. Misfolded proteins can lead to diseases such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and various prion diseases. Understanding protein folding requires a detailed analysis of protein sequences and their interactions, which is computationally challenging due to the vast conformational space.

### Protein Sequences
Proteins are composed of amino acids, and their sequences determine their structure and function. Analyzing protein sequences involves identifying patterns, motifs, and domains that are critical for understanding their biological roles. This project leverages the power of hybrid quantum-classical models to analyze these sequences more effectively.
